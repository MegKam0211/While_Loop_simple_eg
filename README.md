# While_Loop_simple_eg
using Python

Ask the user to enter a number less than 100. 

If they enter one above 100, ask them to try again (and continue to do so until they follow instructions). 

Once they have entered a valid number, check if it is even and if it is then multiply it by 2 and print it out. 

If it isn't, then multiply it by 3 and print it out.
